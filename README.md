## CPU_StressTest

 - This is a project I created one day to push a cpu to its max using dd and /dev

 - It is very simple to use. Just run the script. 
 
  - To run:
  
  - chmod +x cpu_stresstest # make it executable
  
  - ./cpu_stresstest # run it
 
 - When it starts it will open htop. 

 - It runs forever until you press crl-c to close htop
